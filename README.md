   AS a traveler, I want a concise place to organize my wanderings based on geography
   SO I can share with friends and family, and keep my memories organized
   WHEN I travel I want to be able to keep a journal
   FOR that journal I want many geolocations to be associated to each post OR many post can belong to a single geography
   ALSO I need to be able to organize my photos. These photos will be tagged to post/geographies they belong to.

  ## Installation 
  - ```git clone``` the repo. 
  - ```npm install``` to get the dependencies. 
  - ```mysql source``` the schema to instantiate the database, or run in mysql workbench.
  -  update confige/config.json to contain any relevant db changes such as name, password user etc.
  - create .env file at the root level containing SESSION_SECRET=password (password being a password you want to use for your session secret)
  -Upon first run, you will want to make sure the bottom of server.js file has ```force:true``` and ```seedModels()``` for your first sever start (this will build your models and seed the data)  
  - ```npm start``` or ```node server.js``` to start the server running on localhost://3000
  -At this time you should probably set ```force:false``` and comment out ```seedModels()```
  
  ## Usage
  Check out the live version here - [Wandir](https://wandir.herokuapp.com/) -  
  OR With the server running, navigate to localhost://3000 in your browser. 
  
  
  Add photos, delete photos, add geolocations, journal entries or view others journal entries/photos in a non-editable screen. You will have your own login to save all of your travels!
